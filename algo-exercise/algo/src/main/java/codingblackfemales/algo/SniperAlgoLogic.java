// goal: sniper algo aims to "snipe" the best ask price, so tryig to buy as much as possible at the lowest price(the best ask)
// until it has 5 child orders.
// flow:
// 1. logs the current state of the order book.
// 2. retrieves the best ask price.
// 3. if fewer than 5 chld orders exists, it creates a new buy order at the best ask price for the available quantity.
// 4. if 5 or more child orders exist, it does not hing.

// this algo follows a "sniping" strategy, where it aggressively tries to buy at the best available price on the ask side
// until it reaches a treshild of 5 active orders.
